    <h1>Mount Kilauea, Hawaii</h1>
    <p><strong>By:</strong> Student Research Project</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Geographic Location</h2>
        <p>Mount Kilauea is located on the Big Island of Hawaii, in the United States. It sits on the southeastern side of the island inside Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. The volcano rises about 4,000 feet above sea level and is one of five volcanoes that make up the Big Island. Kilauea lies near the Pacific Ocean and is surrounded by lush tropical forests and lava fields.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Geologic Situation</h2>
        <p>Kilauea is a shield volcano formed by a hotspot under the Pacific Plate. This means it is not located at a plate boundary, but rather above a fixed plume of magma rising from deep within the Earth's mantle. The Pacific Plate slowly moves northwest over the hotspot, which is why Hawaii has a chain of volcanoes that get older as you move away from the Big Island. Kilauea has been continuously active for many years and is considered one of the most active volcanoes in the world.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Event Data</h2>
        <p>One of Kilauea’s most significant eruptions happened in May 2018. The eruption began on May 3rd and continued for several months. It destroyed over 700 homes and reshaped parts of the island. The lava flowed into the Pacific Ocean, creating new land along the coast. Kilauea erupted again in 2020 and 2021 inside the Halemaʻumaʻu crater, producing lava fountains and glowing lakes of molten rock. The most recent eruption started in September 2023 but ended a few weeks later.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Effect on Earth and Environment</h2>
        <p>The eruptions of Kilauea have major effects on the land and environment. The lava flows destroy forests and homes, but also create new land when the molten rock cools. The volcanic gases, such as sulfur dioxide, can cause air pollution known as “vog,” which can harm plants and make breathing difficult for people and animals. Over time, however, the volcanic soil becomes very rich in minerals, supporting new plant growth and ecosystems.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Effect on Humans and Civilization</h2>
        <p>Kilauea’s eruptions have had serious impacts on people living nearby. In the 2018 eruption, thousands of residents had to evacuate their homes, and many lost their property to lava flows. Roads and infrastructure were destroyed, cutting off communities. However, Kilauea also attracts millions of tourists each year, helping Hawaii’s economy. Scientists use Kilauea to study volcanoes and improve early warning systems to protect people in the future.</p>

        <h2>Project Design and Creativity</h2>
        <p>This project was designed to present information clearly and simply, using sections that match the research rubric. It focuses on real data and scientific explanations while keeping the layout easy to read and understand.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Research Quality</h2>
        <p>All information in this project was gathered from reliable scientific and educational sources, including the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Hawaii Volcano Observatory reports. The project shows that careful research and analysis were done to understand Mount Kilauea’s structure, activity, and effects.</p>
