                <h2>Biography</h2>

                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Galileo Galilei</p>

                <p><strong>Born/Died:</strong> He was born on February 15, 1564, and died on January 8, 1642.</p>

                <p><strong>Location:</strong> He was born in Pisa, Italy, and lived in Italy most of his life.</p>

                <p><strong>Education:</strong> He went to the University of Pisa. At first he studied medicine, but he liked math more, so he switched.</p>

                <p><strong>Career:</strong> Galileo was a scientist, astronomer, and math teacher. He spent his life studying space and trying to understand how things move.</p>


                <h2>Research or Discovery</h2>

                <p>
                    Galileo made his own telescope and used it to look closely at space.
                    He discovered four moons going around Jupiter.
                    This showed that not everything goes around Earth.
                </p>

                <p>
                    He also saw that the moon was not smooth.
                    It had mountains and craters, just like Earth.
                    His discoveries helped prove that the Sun is at the center of the solar system, not Earth.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Because of Galileo’s work, scientists today use telescopes and evidence to learn about space.
                    He helped change how people understand the universe.
                </p>
