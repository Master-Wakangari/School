        <h1>Galileo Galilei</h1>

        <p><strong>He was the first space person with a telescope.</strong> Others looked at stars, but Galileo was the first to really study them with a telescope he made by himself.</p>

        <p><strong>The moon has impurities.</strong> He saw the moon wasn't a smooth ball. It was all bumpy with mountains and holes, just like Earth!</p>

        <p><strong>He found Jupiter's moons.</strong> He saw four little dots next to Jupiter and realized they were its own private moons going around it. Not everything circles us!</p>

        <p><strong>Venus has a light switch.</strong> Galileo saw Venus change shapes, like our moon. It went from a tiny sliver to a full circle, which proved it was going around the sun.</p>

        <p><strong>The Milky Way is a pile of stars.</strong> He saw it was actually many stars squished together.</p>

        <p>Galileo saw dark spots on the sun (sunspots) and watched them move.</p>

        <p><strong>He was curious and open minded.</strong> He drew everything he saw in a notebook. He was like a detective collecting clues about space.</p>

        <p><strong>He stood up to peer pressure and followed his own beliefs in astronomy.</strong> He believed the sun was the center of the solar system, not Earth. This got him in big trouble.</p>

        <p><strong>He was a true mathematician.</strong> He used math to figure out how far away stuff was and how it moved. He said the universe was a math problem to solve.</p>

        <p><strong>He was eliminated.</strong> The people at the top said he was wrong and put him under house arrest for the rest of his life for ideas and hypotheses on astronomy.</p>
