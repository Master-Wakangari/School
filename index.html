    <h1>Mount Kilauea, Hawaii</h1>
    <p><strong>By:</strong> Wakangari's Volcanoes & Earthquakes Project</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Geographic Location</h2>
        <p>Mount Kilauea is found on the Big Island of Hawaii, United States. It’s on the southeast part of the island, right inside Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. The volcano is around 4,091 feet above sea level and it’s one of five volcanoes that made the Big Island. Mount Kilauea is close to the Pacific Ocean and surrounded by forests and hard lava rock from past eruptions.</p>

        <h2>Geologic Situation</h2>
        <p>Kilauea is called a shield volcano and it formed because of a hotspot under the Pacific Plate. That means it’s not really at a plate boundary, but over a hot plume of magma that comes up from deep underground. The Pacific Plate slowly moves northwest, and that’s why Hawaii has a line of volcanoes that get older the farther you go. Kilauea is one of the most active volcanoes on Earth and it’s been erupting off and on for a very long time.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Event Data</h2>
        <p>One of the biggest eruptions of Kilauea started on May 3rd, 2018. It went on for months and caused a lot of damage. Around 700 houses were destroyed, and new land was made when the lava reached the ocean and cooled down. After that, there were more eruptions in 2020 and 2021 inside the Halemaʻumaʻu crater, which made bright lava fountains and a lava lake. The latest eruption happened in September 2023 but it didn’t last long.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Effect on Earth and Environment</h2>
        <p>The eruptions from Kilauea change the land a lot. Lava burns trees, houses, and everything in the way, but when it cools down it becomes new land. The gases from the volcano, like sulfur dioxide, can make “vog” (volcanic smog), which makes it hard to breathe and hurts plants. But over time, the cooled lava turns into soil that’s very rich for new plants to grow in. So it kind of destroys and creates at the same time.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Effect on Humans and Civilization</h2>
        <p>Kilauea has had big impacts on people. In 2018, thousands had to leave their homes because lava was coming right through neighborhoods. A lot of roads were broken and covered. Even though it caused damage, Kilauea is also a big part of Hawaii’s culture and brings tourists from everywhere. Scientists also study Kilauea to learn more about eruptions so people can stay safe next time.</p>

        <h2>Project Design and Creativity</h2>
        <p>I made this project to explain Mount Kilauea clearly and in my own words. I used different sections so it’s easier to follow along and understand each part of the volcano’s story.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Research Quality</h2>
        <p>All my info came from real science sources, including the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Hawaii Volcano Observatory reports. I read a lot of facts and summaries before writing this in my own way. The project shows that research was actually done to understand how Kilauea works and what effects it has.</p>
