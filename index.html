    <h1> Mount Kilauea, Hawaii </h1>

<section>
    <h2> Geographic Location</h2>
    <p>Mount Kilauea is on the Big Island of Hawaii inside <strong>Hawaii Volcanoes National Park</strong>. It’s in the southeastern part of the island near the Pacific Ocean. The coordinates are around <strong>19.4°N, 155.3°W</strong>. It’s surrounded by lava fields and rainforests.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2> Geologic Situation</h2>
    <p>Kilauea is a <strong>shield volcano</strong> made from thin, runny lava that spreads out and builds wide, gentle slopes. It formed because the <strong>Pacific Plate</strong> is moving over a <strong>hotspot</strong> deep under the Earth. Unlike most volcanoes, it’s not at a plate boundary — the magma just rises straight up through the crust!</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2> Event Data</h2>
    <p>One of the biggest eruptions was on <strong>May 3, 2018</strong>. Lava began flowing in the Puna District and lasted for months. Over <strong>700 homes</strong> were destroyed, and new lava flows reached the ocean.  The eruption officially ended in August 2018, but Kilauea still erupts sometimes today!</p>

</section>

<section>
    <h2> Effect on Earth / Environment</h2>
    <p>The eruption changed the land a lot.  Lava flows covered forests, roads, and even made <strong>new land</strong> along the ocean. The air got filled with volcanic smog (called <strong>vog</strong>) that made breathing hard for some people and animals. Sulfur dioxide gas also made acid rain. But it also created new rock and land that scientists can study!</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2> Effect on Humans / Civilization</h2>
    <p>Over <strong>2,000 people</strong> had to evacuate their homes in 2018. Many lost their houses, farms, and roads. The eruption caused over <strong>$800 million</strong> in damages. But it also helped scientists learn how volcanoes behave and brought attention from tourists all over the world once it was safe again. </p>

    <h2> Project Design and Creativity</h2>
    <p>I used bright colors to make learning about Mount Kīlauea fun and easy to understand. The blue background represents the Hawaiian sky and ocean.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2> Research Quality</h2>
    <p>I found information from <strong>USGS (United States Geological Survey)</strong>, <strong>Hawaii Volcano Observatory</strong>, and the <strong>National Park Service</strong>. I checked multiple sites to ensure the information is accurate and up to date. </p>
